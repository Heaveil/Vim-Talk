Exercise 1:
Using the text below, combine Vim motions to achieve useful functionality.
Suppose you need to clear the content inside the double quotes " ". This can be efficiently done in Vim.

Hint: ci" or di". The benefit of using ci" is that it will enter you into insert mode.


printf("Hello, World!\n");

char* world = "Hello, World\n";


Exercise 2:
Using the text below, practice changing the content inside parentheses ( ).
Hint: ci(


1. void foo(int a, int b)

2. if (x > 0 && (y < 10 || z == 5));

3. int result = (a + b) * (c - d);

4. int value = array[index + (offset * 2)];

5. auto lambda = [](int a, int b) { return a + b; };



Exercise 3:
Using the text below, practice copying the content inside the parentheses ( ).
Hint: yi( or y%

1. void foo(int a, int b)

Combining motions is what makes Vim amazing. Experiment with different verbs, modifiers, and nouns.
